Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools
=====================================

*This page is related to the open-source GIS **Whitebox GAT**. If you are instead interested in the stand-alone command-line program and Python scripting API for geospatial analysis, **WhiteboxTools**, please see this [link](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-geospatial-analysis-tools/tree/master/whitebox_tools).*

Description
-----------
Whitebox GAT is an open-source geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing package (http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/). The Whitebox GAT project began in 2009 and was conceived as a replacement for the Terrain Analysis System (TAS). Whitebox GAT was intended to have a broader focus than its predecessor, positioning it as an open-source desktop GIS and remote sensing software package for general applications of geospatial analysis and data visualization. Whitebox GAT is intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data analysis with applications in both environmental research and the geomatics industry more broadly. It was envisioned from the outset as providing an ideal platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis methods. Equally important is the projectâ€™s goal of providing a tool that can be used for geomatics-based education.

Getting Started
---------------
Compiled versions of Whitebox GAT are available from the Whitebox homepage (http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/). To work with the source code, clone the Github repository using *git*. To build the project, open a command prompt, change directory ('cd') to the directory containing the Whitebox code, and run the build script (python build.py). This will require having the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 installed, along with a Python installation. The executable jar file will be contained in a newly created *release* folder.
