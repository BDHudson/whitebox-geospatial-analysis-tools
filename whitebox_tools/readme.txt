WhiteboxTools

The main tool library is contained in the whitebox_tools (or whitebox_tools.exe on 
MS Windows) file. This is a command-line program that can be run from a terminal, i.e. 
command prompt. For details on usage, change the working directory (cd) to this folder 
and type the following at the command prompt:

./whitebox_tools --help

The following commands are recognized:
--cd, --wd       Changes the working directory; used in conjunction with --run flag.
-h, --help       Prints help information.
-l, --license    Prints the whitebox-tools license.
--listtools      Lists all available tools. Keywords may also be used, --listtools slope.
-r, --run        Runs a tool; used in conjuction with --wd flag; -r="LidarInfo".
--toolbox        Prints the toolbox associated with a tool; --toolbox=Slope.
--toolhelp       Prints the help associated with a tool; --toolhelp="LidarInfo".
--toolparameters Prints the parameters (in json form) for a specific tool; --toolparameters="LidarInfo".
-v               Verbose mode. Without this flag, tool outputs will not be printed.
--viewcode       Opens the source code of a tool in a web browser; --viewcode="LidarInfo".
--version        Prints the version information.

Example Usage:
>> ./whitebox-tools -r=lidar_info --cd="/path/to/data/" -i=input.las --vlr --geokeys


The WhiteboxTools library may also be called from Python automation scripts. The 
whitebox_tools.py script can be used as an easy way of interfacing with the various 
commands. See the user manual for more deails. To use this script, simply use the 
following import:

from whitebox_tools import WhiteboxTools

wbt = WhiteboxTools() 
wbt.work_dir = "/path/to/data/" # Sets the Whitebox working directory

wbt.d_inf_flow_accumulation("DEM.dep", "output.dep", log=True)


Additionally, included in this directory is the WhiteboxTools Runner, a simple Tkinter 
user-interface that allows users to run the WhiteboxTools tools, with convenience for 
specifying tool parameters. To run this interface, simply type:

python3 wb_runner.py

Or, if Python 3 is the default Python intepreter:

python wb_runner.py

At the command prompt (after cd'ing to this folder, which contains the script).

Release Notes:

Version 0.5.0 (DD-MM-YYYY)

- The following tools have been added:
    ElevationAboveStreamEuclidean
    ImageStackProfile
    PrincipalComponentAnalysis
    RasterizeStreams
    
- Updated tools so that the reporting of elapsed time respects verbose mode.

Version 0.4.0 (04-03-2018)

- This release has erognomic improvements for Python scripting with Whitebox. Tools can be called 
  in Python like this:

  wt = WhiteboxTools()
  wt.slope(‘DEM.dep’, ‘slope.dep’)
  
- There is a convenience method in whitebox_tools.py for each tool in the WhiteboxTools binary 
  executable. This makes it far easier to call tools from a Python script. See the User Manual
  for details.
- Significant improvements and revisions have been made to the User Manual, and in particular 
  the section on Python based scripting with WhiteboxTools.
- The following tools have been added to the library:
    LidarColourize
    LidarPointStats
    LidarRemoveDuplicates
    LongProfile
    LongProfileFromPoints
    MaxElevDevSignature
    MultiscaleRoughness
    MultiscaleRoughnessSignature
    PrintGeoTiffTags
    Profile
- Updated Watershed and Viewshed tools to take vector point inputs.
- PennockLandformClass tool modified to have int8 output data type. Also fixed a bug in the input
  parameters.

Version 0.3.1 (15-02-2018)

- No new tools have been added to this release. Instead the focus was on improving and enhancing
  LAS file support and fixing a numbe of bugs. These include the following:
- Support has been added in the LAS file reader for handling Point Record Formats 4-11 in the 
  LAS 1.4 specificiations. This includes enhanced support for 64-bit LAS files. This change 
  resulted in cascading changes throughout the LiDAR infrastructure and LiDAR tools. Future 
  work will focus on writing LAS files in 1.4 format, instead of the current 1.3 format that is
  saved.
- The LidarIdwInterpolation, LidarNearestNeighbourGridding, and LidarPointDensity tools have each
  been modified to enhance the granularity of parallelism when operating in multi-file mode. This 
  has resulted in large improvements in performance when interpolating entire directories of 
  LAS files.
- The LasHeader object now has the ability to read a LAS header directly. This allows 
  interrogation of a LAS file without the need to create a full LAS object. This was useful 
  for identifying neighbouring tiles during interpolation, such that a buffer of points 
  from adjacent tiles can be used, thereby minimizing interpolation edge effects.
- There was a bug with the WhiteboxTools Runner that had issue with the use of a forward-slash (/) 
  in file paths on Windows. These have been fixed now. I also fixed every tool such that the use
  of a forward slash for file paths on Windows won't result in an additional working directory 
  being appended to file names. This one resulted in many files being slightly modified.
- Added the ability to select the working directory in WhiteboxTools Runner. This is a useful
  feature because some of the LiDAR tools now allow for no specified input/output files, in 
  which case they operate on all of the LAS files contained within the working directory.

Version 0.3 (07-02-2018)

- Added the following tools:
    MaxAnisotropyDev
    HysometricAnalysis
    SlopeVsElevationPlot
    LidarRemoveOutliers

- Added initial support for reading Shapefile geometries. This is still a proof-of-concept
  and no tools as of yet use Shapefile inputs. 
- Added functionality to create beautiful and interactive line graph and scattergram 
  outputs for tools.
- LiDAR interpolation tools now have the option to interpolate all LAS files within the 
  working directory when an input file name is not specified.
- Added first draft of a pdf user manual for WhiteboxTools.

Version 0.2 (12-01-2018)

- Added the following tools:
    KSTestForNormality
    RadomSample
    Mosaic
    Resample
    RadiusOfGyration
    KMeansClustering
    ModifiedKMeansClustering
    D8MassFlux
    DInfMassFlux
    RasterHistogram
    LidarHistogram
    CrossTabulation
    ImageAutocorrelation
    ExtractRasterStatistics
    AggregateRaster
    Viewshed

- Fixed several bugs including one affecting the reading of LAS files.

- Numerous enhancements
